**"Defining Low-Income, Low-Access Food Areas"**, Congressional Research Service, 06-01-2021, page 1:
> - low-income (LI): poverty rate of 20% or greater, or median family income at or below 80% of the statewide or metropolitan area median family income; and 
> - low-access (LA): a low-income tract with at least 500 people or 33% of the tractâ€™s population living more than 1 mile (urban areas) or more than 10 miles (rural areas) from the nearest supermarket or grocery store. (USDALA data are also available assuming different measures of distance, ranging 0.5 miles to 20 miles).

**ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer: Denver Urban Gardens, IRS Form 990s**:
- site = https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/742374848
- Note: ProPublica also has an API that allowed me to access this Form 990 information directly from Python as well. HOWEVER, because some of the more interesting information on "Operating Expenses" are included in item #24 of the IRS Form 990, which has "write-in" names of the expense categories, and those "write-in" names are not entered in the same order every year, and the "write-in" names change over time, I also referenced the PDF files to extract that information.
